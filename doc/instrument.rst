JDXi Instrument Window
======================

The **JDXi Instrument Window** lets you directly control and modify the parameters of your Roland JD-Xi synthesizer in real time. This window serves as your main interface for sculpting sounds, performing, and accessing key settings for each of the JD-Xi’s components.

Features
--------

- **Part Control:** Adjust settings for each of the four main parts — Digital 1, Digital 2, Analog, and Drums — including oscillator parameters, filter settings, envelope controls, and effects.

- **Mixer Section:** Change the volume, panning, and routing for each synth and drum part.

- **Effect Controls:** Access and modify effects such as delay, reverb, distortion, and compression directly from the window.

- **Vocal Transformer:** Enable or disable and fine-tune the vocal effects, adding texture and character to your performance.

- **Arpeggiator and Sequencer:** Control the arpeggiator patterns and step sequencer for automated or rhythmical variation in your compositions.

- **On-Screen Keyboard:** The JDXi Instrument Window includes a virtual MIDI keyboard that lets you preview and perform notes directly without needing a physical controller.

- **Real-Time MIDI Communication:** All parameter tweaks made within this window are transmitted to the JD-Xi in real time, allowing for a fully interactive and tactile sound design experience.

Using the Instrument Window
----------------------------

- Select a **part** to edit by clicking the appropriate button, which opens the corresponding tab of the Editor Window.
- Adjust its parameters using the respective **sliders**, **knobs**, and **dropdown menus**.
- Monitor and preview your tweaks in real time by sending notes with the **on-screen keyboard** or from your MIDI controller.
- All settings can be **written back to the JD-Xi** or **stored as a patch** for future use.
