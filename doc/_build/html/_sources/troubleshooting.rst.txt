----------------

**Slow boot up time** The program as a lot of sliders and windows to generate, so it may take 30 seconds to a minute or so to boot up.

MacOS
------
**Program doesn't load at all!** Sometimes the program doesn't load, perhaps due to the Midi communication with the instrument not occurring properly. Rebooting the computer usually solves this problem.

Windows
