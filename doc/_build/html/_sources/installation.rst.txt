   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Installation
============

1) Install the JD-Xi Editor

The JD-Xi Editor is packaged under both MacOS as a .app, in a DMG file, and under Windows as an Nullsoft Installer (NSIS) file.

MacOS:

.. code-block:: console

   $ open JD-Xi-Editor-0.8.dmg

Windows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ jdxi-editor-0.8_windows_setup.exe


Icons should then appear in the Applications folder under MacOS, and in the Users folder under Windows.
