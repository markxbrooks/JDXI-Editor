Quick Start
===========

Once Installation is complete, the JD-Xi Editor can be run from the Applications folder under MacOS, and from the Program Files folder under Windows.

The two main components to the JD-Xi Editor are the JDXi Editor Instrument Window, and the JD-Xi Editor Window.

Notes can be played on the keyboard, and the JD-Xi Editor will send the MIDI notes to the instrument.

The JD-Xi Editor can be used to edit the different parameters of the JD-Xi instrument, such as the different synths, effects, and vocal effects.

Connection of the JD-Xi Hardware Instrument to the Computer
---------------

Use a USB-B ('host') to USB A or C cable to connect to the USB host connection on the instrument. Connect the other, non-host end to the computer.

Power up the instrument, and then start the JD-Xi software.

The software should auto-connect to the JD-Xi midi input and output ports, but if not a midi-configuration window should open, with which ports can be browsed from and appropriate and selected.
