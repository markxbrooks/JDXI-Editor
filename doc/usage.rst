Introduction
============

Once Installation is complete, the JDXi Editor can be run from the Applications folder under MacOS, and from the Program Files folder under Windows.

The two main components to the JDXi Editor are the JDXi Editor Instrument Window, and the JDXi Editor Window.

Notes can be played on the keyboard, and the JDXi Editor will send the MIDI notes to the JDXi instrument.

The JDXi Editor can be used to edit the different parameters of the JDXi instrument, such as the different synths, effects, and vocal effects.
