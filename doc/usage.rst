Usage of the Editor
====================

Once Installation is complete, the JDXi Editor can be run from the Applications folder under MacOS, and from the Program Files folder under Windows.

The two main components to the JDXi Editor are the JDXi Editor Instrument Window, and the JDXi Editor Window.

Notes can be played on the keyboard, and the JDXi Editor will send the MIDI notes to the JDXi instrument.

The JDXi Editor can be used to edit the different parameters of the JDXi instrument, such as the different synths, effects, and vocal effects.

Connection of the JD-Xi Hardware Instrument to the Computer
---------------

Use a USB 'host' cable to connect to the USB host connection on the instrument. Connect the other, non-host end to the computer.

Power up the instrument, and then start the JD-Xi software.

The software should auto-connect to the JD-Xi midi input and output ports, but if not a midi-configuration window should open, with which ports can be browsed from and appropriate and selected.
