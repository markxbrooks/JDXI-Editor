"""
Module for defining drum kit parameters in the Roland JD-Xi editor.

This module provides the `DrumPartialParameter` class, which extends `SynthParameter`
to define the addresses, value ranges, and characteristics of drum partial parameters.
It includes various attributes representing different drum-related parameters, such as
tuning, level, panning, and effects settings.

Classes:
    DrumPartialParameter -- Represents a drum partial parameter with its address,
                            value range, and optional display range.

Attributes:
    DRUM_GROUP_MAP -- Mapping of drum groups.
    DRUM_ADDRESS_MAP -- Mapping of parameter names to MIDI addresses.

Example usage:
    drum_param = DrumPartialParameter(0x0F, 0, 127)
    print(drum_param.address)  # Output: 0x0F
    print(drum_param.min_val)  # Output: 0
    print(drum_param.max_val)  # Output: 127
