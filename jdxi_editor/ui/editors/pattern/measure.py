extract_measure
===============

Extracts a single measure from a midi file.

Example usage
=============
>>>midi_file = 'your_midi_file.mid'  # Replace with your MIDI file path
...measure_to_extract = 2  # Extract notes from the second measure
...extracted_notes = extract_measure(midi_file, measure_to_extract)

>>>print(f"Notes in measure {measure_to_extract}:")
...for note in extracted_notes:
...   print(note)
