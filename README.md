# JDXI-Editor

![Roland JD-Xi Cartoon](./resources/jdxi_cartoon_600.png)

**JDXI-Editor** is an editor for the **Roland JD-Xi** synthesizer, written in **Python** using the **Qt Framework** and **RtMidi**.

It’s designed to implement as many features as possible from Roland’s MIDI implementation—without the need to dive through hardware menus. 🎛️

> ⚠️ This app is a work in progress and not yet feature-complete—but feel free to try it out and share your feedback!
